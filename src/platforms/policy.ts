// ─── Platform policy: portal rules that shape the UI and what a build ships ──
//
// Pure — no `import.meta.env`, no Vue, no `window` — so the SAME rules are read
// by `vite.config.ts` (which decides what gets aliased out of a build) and by
// the app (through the build-time `platformPolicy` in `capabilities.ts`).
// Adding a portal rule means adding a field here, not another scattered
// `VITE_APP_*` check in a component.
//
// The app does not call the resolver itself: `vite.config.ts` resolves the
// policy ONCE for the build it configures and hands the result to the app as
// the compile-time constant `__PLATFORM_POLICY__`. The two readers therefore
// cannot disagree, and no portal name has to ship in a bundle to decide a
// rule at runtime (the Playgama release is held to exactly that — see
// `tools/playgama-release/gates.mjs`).
